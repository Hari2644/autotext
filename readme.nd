I referred to an existing open-source project to understand the fundamentals of auto-typing text effects. Using it as a learning base,
I modified the design, added new interactive features like color customization, speed control, pause/resume functionality, and multiple text support. 
This helped me improve my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also allowing me to add my own creative touch.
My intention was purely educational â€” to learn, practice, and grow as a developer by building something meaningful.
